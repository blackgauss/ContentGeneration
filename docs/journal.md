## Observations

After approximately five days of experimentation, I have gathered observations regarding the potential usefulness of this project. Initially, I will address some significant challenges.

## Challenges

1. **Content is NOT coherent**
   - The script frequently lacks coherence with the footage, resulting in an incoherent and uninteresting narrative.

2. **Content is NOT engaging**
   - Current social media platforms heavily prioritize watch time. The shorts produced attain at best around 30% watch time on YouTube and roughly 20% on TikTok. Achieving better results necessitates finding the right blend of background footage and script. However, the voiceover format inherently struggles to retain viewers. The scripts suffer from poor pacing, presenting a monotonous and repetitive narrative. This lack of engagement cannot be compensated for by the background footage, as using viral footage may lead to issues with originality.

3. **Content is NOT original**
   - Each video is solely based on a single Reddit post, making it challenging to compete with high-quality videos that draw from multiple sources for script research and video content.

4. **Content is repetitive**
   - The program's output adheres to a single format, limiting diversity and revealing its automated nature.

### Summary

These challenges render this program **currently unsustainable** for building a genuine following. Social media platforms strongly discourage repetitive and unoriginal content, making it unlikely to gain visibility on timelines. It simply cannot rival content created by dedicated human creators.

## Future Direction

1. **Rethink Content Creation Process**
   - Lack of experience in content creation is a major weakness. Understanding the methodologies employed by successful content creators, from research to production and revision, is crucial to improving this project's novelty and quality.

2. **Rethink Market Research**
   - Focusing on a specific audience and tailoring content accordingly significantly enhances engagement. The broad scope of "Modern Encyclopedia" fails to address a particular niche. Crafting a more targeted version could yield better performance and favorability on platforms like TikTok and YouTube.

3. **More Intelligent Use of AI**
   - Utilizing LLMs (Large Language Models) more effectively to craft better scripts and assist in video creation beyond basic prompt fulfillment.

4. **More Formats**
   - Redefining the concept of short-form content beyond presenting information with engaging visuals in 60 seconds. Designing formats optimized for engagement and sharing is essential.

### Summary

Improvements in market research and content creation processes are key. Greater integration of AI technology could aid these efforts.

# Conclusion

This project shows promise, with vast potential for further development. Focusing on enhancing novelty, quality, and content formats will lead to substantial improvements. There are numerous feasible paths forward, but at present, creativity in crafting high-quality content outweighs simply increasing reliance on chatGPT.
