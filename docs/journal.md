## Observations

After about five days of this experiments I have some observations on how likely it is something like this could be useful. First I will highlight some challenges.

## Challenges
1. Content is NOT coherent
- The script does not match the footage. Quite often the script is pretty incoherent and boring.

2. Content is NOT engaging
Social media platforms currently value watchtime heavily. 
As of right now these shorts can get at best ~30% watch time on YouTube and ~20% watch time on TikTok (some distribution with these as modes). The right combination of background footage and script can sometimes generate better results.  It is clear that the voiceover format is **fundamentally limited** in its ability to retain viewers. The only avenues to get attention is through the script and background footage. The scripts suffer from poor pacing and are just a long monotone narrative. This is boring and EXTREMELY repetitive. The background footage cannot carry the viewership. And even if you find some viral background footage you'll probably get flagged for unoriginal content.

3. Content is NOT original
Each video is made with only one reddit post as reference. This cannot compete with actual quality videos which have multiple sources for both script research and video sources.

4. Content is repetiive
There is only one format that the program outputs which limits the diversity of the page and ultimately makes it obviously inorganic and autoamted.

### Summary: 
These challenges make this program **currently unsustainable** for growing a real page. The social media platforms strongly bias against repetive and unoriginal content and it is unlikely to be pushed on timelines. It simply cannot compete with real dedicated humans.

## Future Direction
1. Rethink Content Creation Process
I believe one major weakness is my lack of understanding what actually makes succesful content. I have no experience actually being a content creator so I am bound to fail and replicating the process. The novelty of this project will likely increase if I understand better how actual creators create their work. From research to production and revision I need to understand their recipe well.

2. Rethink Market Research
Along the lines of direction 1, chosing an audience and being a good fit for that audience can drastically increase engagement. "Modern Encyclopedia" is very broad and unlikely to adress a certain niche. It is certainly just trying to ride the wave of other faceless accounts. If I can make a more targeted version of this it could perform better and be better favored by TikTok and YouTube.

3. More Intelligent Use of AI
The most basic way to use chatGPT is by using it as a magic genie to fufil your prompt request. I think this is a relativly low intelligence use and I need to rethink how to use LLMs to create better scripts and to even help with the video creation.

4. More Formats
Rethinking what shortform content is would be helpful. My current model is just to give some piece of information with engaging visuals within 60 seconds. However, the goal is to optimize for engagement and sharing. I can design a short form format which has these in mind.

### Summary

Market research and content creation have many areas that can be improved. Increasing use of AI technology could help with these efforts.

# Conclusion
The project is promising and more is possible than ever before. Thinking deeply about how to improve the novelty, quality, and format of the content will lead to the greatest increase in results. Ther are are many possible forward directions. Currently, I believe being creative about how to make quality content is more important than increasing use of chatGPT.
